# Module 2 assignment
Here is my anime list for my second assignment.
For more details : [module 2 assignment](https://uciunex.instructure.com/courses/16458/assignments/200843?module_item_id=716579).

### How does it work ?
- First, use the command : **git clone** to clone the repository
- Next, with the command : **npm run start** you should be able to run the _index.js_ file
- Finally, you can open and search "**localhost:3000**" in your browser
Normally you should be able to browse my website. Push the "click here for more details" button to see my anime list.
Moreover, in the anime list page, if you click the buttons and then press them again, the text disappears to be replaced by the background image.
